<p><b>Some fun facts about the bridge!</b></p>

    <li>Although it appears red, the color of the bridge is actually painted International Orange.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The bridge is continuously painted due to high salt content in the air.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The bridge was originally painted with lead based primer and topcoat.</li>
